\maketitle

Thought about generalizing the binary to decimal and hex to decimal functions in exercise 1 and 2. Could have added a base parameter to the function to convert from any base number to decimal. In order to do that I would need to make sure the strings were valid outside of the function, or pass in a comparison function which I wasn't keen to do.
