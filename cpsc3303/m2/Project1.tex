\begin{document}

\maketitle

Written in Java and compiled using OpenJDK 14.0.2 2020-07-14. 
Three standalone programs are included in the zip file:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exercise1 
  \item Exercise2 
  \item Exercise3
\end{enumerate}

For exercises 1 \& 2, I thought about generalizing the binary to decimal and hex to decimal functions in exercise 1 and 2. Could have added a base parameter to the function to convert from any base number to decimal. In order to do that I would need to make sure the strings were valid outside of the function, or pass in a comparison function. I decided against this for the sake of simplicity.

For exercise 3, while I'm comfortable with bitwise operations, they definitely are not my first approach to a problem. Seeing how we can convert a number from decimal to binary using bitwise operations made me kick myself for not thinking of it during the module 1 assignment. The bitwise solution is much more simple and straighforward.
