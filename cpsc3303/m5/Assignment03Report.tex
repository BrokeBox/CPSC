Code compiles and runs successfully on Windows 7 using VS 2017 (v141) targeting Windows SDK 10.0.17134.0.

This assignment was much more challenging than I anticipated it to be after reading over the pdf.The most challenging part for me was managing registers and variables. 

Deciding when to push something out into memory and when to keep it in the CPU was difficult. There seems to be a balance between declaring a variable for everything, and bending over backwards to keep data in the registers.

It was also difficult to make sure that $\verb|PROC|$s didn't stomp all over the variables and registers. I tried my hardest to make sure the various $\verb|PROC|$s used as few registers and variables as possible in an effort to not corrupt or overwrite the calling $\verb|PROC|$'s data.

As a C++ developer, writing assembly feels as though all of my variables are ``globals'' which is really difficult to get used to.
