\maketitle

Code compiles and runs successfully on Windows 7 using VS 2017 (v141) targeting Windows SDK 10.0.17134.0.

It was exciting to write and run some assembly code that actually does something interactive with the console. I think the project really highlights the importance and prevelance of bitwise operations when you are working at this low level.

The only issue I had was with trying to use \verb|F0h| to use a mask. The assembler said that it wasn't a valid symbol. I did a little Googling and found out assembler interprets \verb|F0h| as a variable name.

Looking forward to learning how to define functions. The monolithic wall of assembly code was difficiult to look at.
