The install was a little challenging. THe videos on Convas were not working and Malwarebytes suspected the asmirvine website of having Trojans. I added an exception and was able to work through the plain text setup on website.

I was able to succesfully build, run, and debug the Project32 program. I had no idea that the VS debugger could display register values!

Both Project32 and the Template project where targeting Windows SDK versions I do not have. So I had to go into the project properties and retarget from v10.0.16299.0 to v10.0.17134.0. After that I was able to successfully build.

The assembly program worked how I would expect it. The assembly instructions presented in the quizzes was more difficult to work out in my head. The simple MOV instructions and incrementing was pretty straightforward. I did find it interesting to step through with the debugger and watch it work in real-life as opposed to just in my head.
