\paragraph{5.1.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $(9 + 26)^7 = 35^7$
  \item $9 \cdot 35^7$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.1.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $(4 + 10 + 26)^6 = 40^6$
  \item $40^7 + 40^8 + 40^9$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.1.3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $10^5$
  \item $10^4 \cdot 3$
  \item $10^3 \cdot 3^2$
  \item $10^5 \cdot 2$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.2.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $f(x)$ be a function where $x \in B^3$ and $f(x)$ appends the reverse of $x$ to $x$. For example, if $x = 001$ then $f(001) = 001100$. 
  
  The inverse of this function would be to let $y$ equal the length of the string divided by two and remove the last $y$ characters from the string. For example, if $f^{-1}(001100)$ then $y=6/2=3$ and $f^{-1}(001100)=001$. 
  
  Since $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x \in B^3$, $f(x)$ is a bijection.
  \item $|P_6| = |B^3| = 2^3 = 8$
  \item Let $n=4$, for some $x \in B^4$ let $y$ be a string that is constructed by removing the last bit of $x$ and reversing it. $f(x)$ then is given by appending $y$ to $x$. 
  
  For example: if $x = 0010$ then $y =100$ and $f(x) = 0010100$ 
  
  The inverse of this function is given by removing the last $n-1 = 3$ bits from the string. 
  
  For example: $f^{-1}(0010100) = 0010$.
  
  Since $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x \in B^4$, $f(x)$ is a bijection.
  
  Therfore, $|P_7| = |B^4| = 2^4 = 16$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.2.3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $x \in B^9$ and the function $f(x):B^9 \rightarrow E_{10}$. Let $f(x)$ be a function such that if there are an odd number of 1's in $x$ then 1 is prepended to $x$ and if there are an even number of 1's in $x$ then 0 is prepended to $x$.
  
  For example: if $x = 0 0111 1010$ then $f(x) =1x= 10 0111 1010$.
  
  The inverse of this function is given by removing the first digit from the string.
  
  For example: $f^{-1}(10 0111 1010) = 0 0111 1010$
  
  Since $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x \in B^9$, $f(x)$ is a bijection.
  \item $|E_{10}| = |B^9| = 2^9 = 512$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.3.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $Digits + Letters + Specials = 10 + 26 + 4 = 40$
        
  Number of passwords $= 40 \cdot 39 \cdot 38 \cdot 37 \cdot 36 \cdot 35 = 2,763,633,600$
  \item Number of passwords $= 36 \cdot 39 \cdot 38 \cdot 37 \cdot 36 \cdot 35 = 2,487,270,240$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.3.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $3 \cdot 2^9 = 1,536$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.3.4}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Working in reverse order, assign devs to projects 3, 2, and then 1.
  
  $7 \cdot 3 \cdot (6+2) = 168$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.4.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A function must map each $x \in \{0,1\}^7$ to an element in the target $\{0,1\}^7$. There are $|2^7|$ elements in the domain, and $2^7$ elements in the target. Because this function is not one-to-one or onto, the only requirement is that each $x$ has one and only one $f(x)$. This implies that each of the $2^7$ $x$'s has $2^7$ potential $f(x)$'s. Therfore the number of different functions $f:\{0,1\}^7 \rightarrow \{0,1\}^7$ is 
  
    $$ \left(2^7 \right)^{2^7} = 2^{7 \cdot 2^7}$$
    
  \item Because $f:\{0,1\}^7 \rightarrow \{0,1\}^7$ is one-to-one, the function must map each $x \in \{0,1\}^7$ to a unique element in the target $\{0,1\}^7$. In other words, for the first element in the domain there are $2^7$ possible $f(x)$'s, for the second element there are $2^7 -1$ possible $f(x)$'s, and so on. Therefore the number of functions can be determined by counting permutations 
  
    $$ P(2^7,2^7) = (2^7)! = 3.86e215$$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.4.3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $10! = 3,628,800$
  \item If the groom must be to the immediate left of the bride, you can combine them into one ``person'', i.e. [groom, bride]. Thus there are $9! = 362,880$ different ways to arrange the line up.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.5.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $f((12,1,3,15,19)) = \{12,1,3,15,19\}$
  \item Yes $(12,1,3,15,19)$ is a 5 permutation because the regular parens () indicate the order of the elements matter.
  \item $5! = 120$ permutations are mapped onto the subset $\{12,1,3,15,19\}$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.5.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A 4-permutation from the set S could be $(a,b,c,d)$
  \item A 4-susbet from the set S could be $\{a,b,c,d\}$
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{5.5.8}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\binom{52}{5} = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \frac{52!}{5!47!} = \frac{52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48}{5!} = 2,598,960$
  \item There are 4 suits that evenly divide the deck so there are $52/4 = 13$ hearts. From this subset of 13, choose 2 cards $\binom{13}{2}$. Subtract these two from the deck and pick the other 3 cards $\binom{50}{3}$. Combined together yields 
  
    $$\binom{13}{2} \cdot \binom{50}{3} = \frac{13!}{2!(11-2)!} \cdot \frac{50!}{3!(50-3)!}$$
    
  \item Since each suit has 13 cards there are 26 total hearts and diamonds. From this subset of 26, choose 5 cards 
  
    $$\binom{26}{5} = \frac{26!}{5!(26-5)!}$$
    
  \item Each rank exists 4 times in the deck, 1 time for each suit. Picking the first card determines the suit and rank of the next 3, which leaves one other card to pick from the remaining 48 cards.
    \begin{align*}
      \binom{52}{1} &\cdot \binom{48}{1} \\
      \frac{52!}{1!(52-1)!} &\cdot \frac{48!}{1!(48-1)!} \\
      52 &\cdot 48 = 2496 
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.6.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Since the teacher selected an unordered set of 4 students to work together, there are $\binom{37}{4} = \frac{37!}{4!(37-4)!}$ ways to select the students.
  \item Since the students consume a job as they are picked, students form a permutation. Therefore there are $P(37,4) = \frac{37!}{(37-4)!}$ ways to select the students and assign jobs.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.6.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Since the 30 selected pianists are not ranked or ordered in any way, there are $\binom{120}{30} = \frac{120!}{30!(120-30)!}$ outcomes for the first round.
  \item Since the winners of the second round consume a place as they are selected, the pianists form a permutation. Therfore there are $P(30,5) = \frac{30!}{(30-5)!}$ outcomes for the second round.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.6.6}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We must choose 5 from each party in no particular order. So there are $\binom{44}{5}$ possible choices for Demonstrators and $\binom{56}{5}$ possible choices for Repudiators. Combined together gives 
    \begin{align*}
      \binom{44}{5} &\cdot \binom{56}{5} \\
      \frac{44!}{5!(44-5)!} &\cdot \frac{56!}{5!(56-5)!} \\
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.7.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item There are $\binom{52}{5}$ possible 5-card hands. Removing the 13 clubs from the deck, there are $\binom{39}{5}$ possible 5 card hands without a club. Therefore there are 
    $$\binom{52}{5} - \binom{39}{5} = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} - \frac{39!}{5!(39-5)!}$$
  possible 5-hand cards with at least one club.
  \item There are 13 unique ranks in a deck. From this subset of 13, pick 5 ranks for a total of $\binom{13}{5}$ different 5-card hands that has no two cards of the same rank. Subtracting this from the total number of 5 card hands gives
    $$\binom{52}{5} - \binom{13}{5} = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} - \frac{13!}{5!(13-5)!}$$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.8.1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 6 total letters, no characters repeat so there are $6! = 720$ total permutations of NUMBER.
  \item DISCRETE has 8 total letters. E is the only repeated character, and it is in the string 2 times. Therefore there are 
    $$\binom{8}{1}\cdot\binom{7}{1}\cdot\binom{6}{1}\cdot\binom{5}{1}\cdot\binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{2}\cdot\binom{1}{1} $$
    $$= \frac{8!}{2!1!1!1!1!1!1!0!} = \frac{8!}{2!}$$
  ways to permute the letters in DISCRETE.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.8.3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item From the deck, choose 13 cards to give to a player, and repeat for each of the 4 players. Therefore there are 
    $$\binom{52}{13} \cdot \binom{39}{13} \cdot \binom{26}{13} \cdot \binom{13}{13}$$
    $$= \frac{52!}{13!13!13!13!}$$
  different ways to deal four players exactly 13 cards.
  \item From the deck, choose 7 cards to give to a player, and repeat for each of the 4 players, leaving the remain cards in the deck. Therefore there are 
    $$\binom{52}{7} \cdot \binom{45}{7} \cdot \binom{38}{7} \cdot \binom{31}{7}$$
    $$= \frac{52!}{7!7!7!7!}$$
  different ways to deal four players 7 cards and leave the rest in the deck.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5.8.4}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first kid has the option to pick anywhere between 0 and 20 comic books. Let $x_1$ be the number of comic books the first kid picks, $x_2$ is the number the second picks, and so on. Then there are 
    $$ \frac{20!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!x_5!} $$
  Ways to distribute the comic books. Where $x_n \leq 20 - x_1...-x_{n-1}$ for $1 < n \leq 4$ and $x_5 = 20-x_1-x_2-x_3-x_4$.
\end{enumerate}
