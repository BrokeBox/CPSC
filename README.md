Auburn Computer Science Coursework

Hello! This repository holds my work from my time in Auburn University's Computer Science Bachelor program. Inside you will find all my programming assignments and projects as well as some papers I wrote using LaTeX. 

If this violates Auburn's academic integrity policy, please let me know and I will take it down.
