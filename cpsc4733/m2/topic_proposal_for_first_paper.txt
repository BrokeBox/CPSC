Does the government have the right compel/force individuals/organizations to decrypt their data? 

From some brief research I did, this looks like a very gray area of legal codes around the world. There seems to be dispute about self-incrimination. While there's certainly court rulings on the subject in many countries, not all courts are agreeing. Some courts in the just the US are disagreeing. Another interesting point is that even if police have a warrant to the data, with good enough encryption they would have no reasonable means to access the data. So there seems to be a fine line between self-incrimination and obstruction/contempt.
